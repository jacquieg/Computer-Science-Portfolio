<h1>Welcome to Jacquie's website</h1>
    <p> Welcome to my website!!! You will learn all about <strong>MY</strong> Computer Science class. I will talk you through my progress in this class, HTML and CSS tags, computer hardware, and you will also get to learn a little bit about me </p>
    <h2>Introduction to Computer Science</h2>
    <p>Computer Science class is where you go to learn all about HTML and CSS as well as learning about computer hardware.So far, i've learned all about HTML and CSS tags which help you when you're in the process of creating your own website. a few out of many examples of what these tags can help with are:
    <li>choosing how to style your page</li>
    <li> choosing the colors you have on your page</li>
    <li>choosing the size of the content on your page </li></p>
    <h3>purpose to computer science</h3>
     <p>The main purpose of this class is to know all about computer progamming. Like i've mentioned before, we have been learning all about HTML and CSS which help us create our own webpage and we are in the process of learning about computer hardware, but there is still more to learn. Soon enough, we will be able to know how to:</p>
    <li>re-build computers and know all about the hardware</li>
    <li> know more about HTML and CSS</li>
    <li> create our own webpages</li>
    <h4> -overview-</h4>
    <p>There's isn't anything i really haven't mentioned, but in case you forgot...on this webpage you will be able to find information about HTML and CSS, infomation and images of computer hardware,and you will find infomation on <strong>ME!!!</strong>
